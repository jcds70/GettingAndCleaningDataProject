GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================
There is only one .R script for this project which does all of the required steps, called run_analysis.R.

The script contains comments which describe where each of the required steps are implemented and what the code is doing at each step.

To run the script first download the ZIP file with the class project data and extract it into a folder, then set the R working directory to this folder and run the script.  It will load and process the data and write the final tidy data file to a file called "final_tidy_data.txt".  It can take a minute or two to run.
